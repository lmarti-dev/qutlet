# What is this?

Simple library for studying qubit-based models, though aimed at fermionic models in particular. It's built on top of cirq and openfermion, and extends many functionalities, especially with regards to models with a fixed number of electrons. The Fermi-Hubbard model is also a bit more customizable here, and there are a few other similar models.

It was originally planned for VQEs so you can also do that too, using the Ansatz class. There's a few ans√§tze already built in circuits. ADAPT-VQE is also doable.
